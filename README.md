# Technologies Learned

### 1. Express

Express.js is the backbone of this project, serving as the web application framework for Node.js. It has empowered me to build efficient and scalable server-side applications.

### 2. Mongoose

Mongoose, a MongoDB object modeling tool, has been instrumental in designing and interacting with my database schema. It provided a structured approach to managing MongoDB documents.

### 3. MongoDB

MongoDB, a NoSQL database, was chosen for its flexibility and scalability. I've learned to create, read, update, and delete records in MongoDB, enabling seamless integration with my Express.js application.

### 4. JSON Web Token (JWT)

Implementing JSON Web Tokens for authentication has been a crucial aspect of my project. JWTs allowed me to secure my API endpoints and manage user authentication in a stateless manner.

### 5. Bcrypt

Bcrypt played a pivotal role in securing user passwords. Its hashing and salting mechanisms ensured the confidentiality and integrity of user credentials in the database.

### 6. Router

Express Router facilitated the modularization of my code, making it more organized and maintainable. I learned to structure my routes effectively, enhancing the overall readability of the codebase.

### 7. Dotenv

Dotenv proved to be an invaluable tool for managing environment variables in my project. It helped me keep sensitive information secure and separate from the codebase.

## API Development and Testing

I have meticulously designed and implemented RESTful APIs using Express.js routes. These APIs serve as the core functionality of my application. Testing was performed using POSTMAN, ensuring that each endpoint functions as intended and handles various scenarios gracefully.

## Version Control with Git

The entire project is version-controlled using Git. I have regularly committed my code, providing a detailed commit history to track changes and improvements over time. The repository is on GitHub, making it accessible for collaboration and showcasing my progress as a developer.

## Deployment with Render

For deploying my application, I chose Render. The platform's simplicity and scalability allowed me to showcase my project to everyone.


## Happy coding!
